Apply your newly acquired skills to one of the most famous NLP datasets out there: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). As part of the job selection process, some of my friends have been asked to create analysis of this dataset, so I want to empower you to have a head start.  \n",

You can analyze the full dataset as a stretch goal or after the sprint challenge. As you work on the challenge, I suggest adding notes about your findings and things you want to analyze in the future.\n",

Don't believe you're entitled to everything in life, and you'd be amazed about how less stressed your life can become! Colton is one of the baristas there, and he is awesome. Always recommending drinks for me. The manager is super nice as well. I have spoken with her a couple times, and she is the one wearing the black apron.

The parking can be a little hectic especially if you get caught up in the heart of the pedestrian area but if you just park on the outskirts by one of the anchor stores it's not bad at all. The mall is layed out nicely with wide open walkways and misters when it's hot. Recently I have taken my baby niece to the splash pad and play area which are both great for the little ones. The mall is kept very clean and there are plenty of spots to sit down and relax. Lots of great stores to choose from including higher end and also your average mall stores. It of course gets a quite hot in the summer and is much more enjoyable in the fall/winter months but would not be bad to stop by if you had a specific store in mind in the summer. There are also multiple great restaurants to try including, Kona Grill, Blue Wasabi, and Cantina Laredo to name just a few.\n",

Great personal help here. Low pressure. Jeans to fit anyone. I hate clothes shopping, hate the mall. This was a great experience. In addition, you can \"reserve\" clothing using the Buckle App. Staff gather your items and then you are notified when they are ready for pickup. You pay for the items at the store.
