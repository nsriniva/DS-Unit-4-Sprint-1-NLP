Apply your newly acquired skills to one of the most famous NLP datasets out there: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). As part of the job selection process, some of my friends have been asked to create analysis of this dataset, so I want to empower you to have a head start.  \n",

You can analyze the full dataset as a stretch goal or after the sprint challenge. As you work on the challenge, I suggest adding notes about your findings and things you want to analyze in the future.\n",

If you have a negative attitude towards others, of course they won't be friendly back. Don't believe you're entitled to everything in life, and you'd be amazed about how less stressed your life can become! Colton is one of the baristas there, and he is awesome. Always recommending drinks for me. The manager is super nice as well. I have spoken with her a couple times, and she is the one wearing the black apron. If you're not aware, that black apron took a long time to achieve, so congrats to her!\n",

As mentioned in other reviews, some of the sales people at the kiosks can be a bit aggressive, but there are ones that are content to stare at their phones and look pretty.\n",

The mall is layed out nicely with wide open walkways and misters when it's hot. Recently I have taken my baby niece to the splash pad and play area which are both great for the little ones. The mall is kept very clean and there are plenty of spots to sit down and relax. Lots of great stores to choose from including higher end and also your average mall stores. It of course gets a quite hot in the summer and is much more enjoyable in the fall/winter months but would not be bad to stop by if you had a specific store in mind in the summer. There are also multiple great restaurants to try including, Kona Grill, Blue Wasabi, and Cantina Laredo to name just a few.\n",
