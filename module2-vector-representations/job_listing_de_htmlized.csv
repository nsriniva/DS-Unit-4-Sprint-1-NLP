in this role you will help us improve the quality of textio's current genre-defining models and you will create the new models that will power textio's future products. you will work with a top-notch team of data scientists, engineers, product managers, and others to turn textio's rich linguistic data into user-facing products that provide a unique balance of predictive power, model introspection, and user guidance. your influence will span from data cleaning/curation to model development to the systems and processes that we use to evolve and deploy our models.

you will be joining a welcoming and collaborative data science team at a company that deeply understands the value of data. textio is a phenomenal place to build, learn, experiment, and deliver impact as a data scientist. come join us!
what you'll be doing:
iteratively improving the predictive power and the quality of user guidance generated by textio's current user-facing models, and extending this work into new domains to support future products
continuously assessing and communicating model quality through intrinsic metrics (e.g. accuracy) and extrinsic metrics (e.g. measures of customer experience)
curating the datasets that textio uses to train and evaluate our models, using domain knowledge to inform your choices
collaborating with textio's data platform engineers to evolve the systems, processes, and abstractions that textio uses to train, test, and ship models to production
contributing analytical expertise wherever it is most needed to move textio forward: customer-facing products, internal data products, and ad-hoc analysis
strengthening textio's data science and related teams through mentorship, partnership, and technical leadership
we'd love to hear from you if:
you have experience building interpretable models that blend predictive power and explainability
you have shipped a variety of predictive models into production, and from this experience you have developed a point of view on model experimentation and shipping practices
your work is guided by business context and data constraints with a bias for practicality and simplicity
you take a data-centric approach to modeling. you build a deep understanding of your data and problem domain and draw on this context to iteratively test hypotheses that improve your models
you have a demonstrated history of mentorship and technical leadership. you enjoy investing time into the growth of your colleagues
you are comfortable working in ambiguous problem spaces, but you can map out a path to increased clarity and independently take concrete steps along this path
you thrive in an environment that believes that prototypes speak louder than specs
you take pride in the things you create
you demonstrate a track record of trying and learning new things
you're able to communicate your point of view but are low ego
we want to work with awesome and innovative people who can help us use data to make textio the best that it can be.

what you’ll do
conduct rigorous, careful statistical and econometric analysis in support of our research priorities
manage relationships with our outside research partners to ensure research collaborations run smoothly
collaborate with in-country policy teams to develop research that speaks to their local contexts
develop deep cross-functional relationships with product, legal, and operations to ensure alignment between policy research and business strategy
present results to business stakeholders and the academic and policy communities

what you’ll need
masters or phd degree with (anticipated graduation in 2019) in economics, statistics, math, engineering, computer science, or another quantitative field
minimum 1 year of quantitative research or data science experience
strong data skills and experience with tools such as sql, python, and r to work efficiently at scale
ability to work independently and execute a research plan with minimal oversight
ability to organize and synthesize analyses and communicate data insights with clarity

about the team

the policy economics team conducts rigorous research that places our business and driver-partners in the context of the economies in which uber operates. our mission is to help people both inside and outside uber understand the unique nature of our independent work model and how it interacts with the wider world of work. for example: we know that the flexible work model is very valuable to uber drivers (see chen et al., angrist et al.) and that dynamic pricing is vital in protecting the health and efficiency of the dispatch market (see castillo et al., “surge pricing solves the wild goose chase”); however, it’s likely that consistency (e.g., of pricing or earnings) also carries some value for riders and drivers. what values should we put on these opposing virtues?"

our values
----------

we believe we can help build a future for everyone.


we aim to be daring, but humble: we look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
we want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: we want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
stay close to the real problems: we engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.

our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. to that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

the opportunity
---------------

our mission is to support science and technology that will help make it possible to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. interdisciplinary teams of physicians, biologists, computational scientists, and engineers can expand our understanding of the human body and illness — the very science behind medicine. czi fosters collaboration between scientists and engineers, develops tools and technologies, and builds support for basic scientific research.

snowflake is growing fast and we’re scaling our team to help enable and accelerate our growth. we’re passionate about our people, our customers, our values and our culture! we’re also looking for people with a growth mindset and the pragmatic insight to solve for today while building for the future. and as a snowflake employee, you will be accountable for supporting and enabling diversity and belonging.

snowflake started with a clear vision: make modern data warehousing effective, affordable, and accessible to all data users. because traditional on-premises and cloud solutions struggle with this, snowflake developed an innovative product with a new built-for-the-cloud architecture that combines the power of data warehousing, the flexibility of big data platforms, and the elasticity of the cloud at a fraction of the cost of traditional solutions.

in addition, snowflake’s culture was built on the following values that are even more important to us today:

put customers first. we only succeed when our customers succeed
integrity always. be open, honest, and respectful
think big. be ambitious and have big goals
be excellent. quality and excellence count in everything we do
get it done. results matter!
own it
make each other the best
embrace each others differences

in this role you will work closely with product managers, analysts, and engineers to help build data products that inform customers how to optimize their use of snowflake. you will uncover insights about how customers use snowflake. and you will work on research projects to help drive our long-run product strategy.
as a data scientist, you will:
sleuth through large amounts of data to uncover feature-usage patterns, potential performance enhancements, and areas to improve user experience.
build data products that help inform our customers how to optimize their use of snowflake.
identify and build solutions for operational use cases—e.g., system monitoring and alerting, outlier detection, etc.
help design and execute experiments and a/b tests.
use data to make recommendations on how to improve our self-service experience.
think creatively to find optimal solutions to our complex, typically unstructured problems.
our ideal candidate will have:
5+ years of experience working as a data scientist.
3+ years of experience working with truly large-scale data.
advanced sql skills.
strong written and verbal communication skills.
expert-level abilities building and deploying unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised models on large-scale data (in that order of importance).
a fluidity with tools commonly used for data analysis such as python (numpy, pandas, and scikit learn), r, and spark (mllib).
experience with time-series forecasting.
experience building and deploying production-grade models in a real-time setting.
experience with a compiled programming language, preferably something that runs on the jvm.
experience with mpp databases, such as snowflake, redshift, bigquery, vertica, etc.
familiarity with data visualization tools/frameworks as well as notebooks.
a degree of comfort at the command line. that means a thorough understanding of basic file-system commands, as well as the ability to ssh into remote machines and troubleshoot without a gui, grep through logs, and deploy scripts and applications.
familiarity with git and/or svn.
the ability to thrive in a dynamic environment. that means being flexible and willing to jump in and do whatever it takes to be successful.
please show us what you’ve built by including a link to your github profile.
